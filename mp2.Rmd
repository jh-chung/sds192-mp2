## Loading the data

This project is so interesting and relevant to my life!

```{r, include=FALSE}
load("house_elections.rda")
load("candidates.rda")
load("committees.rda")
load("contributions.rda")
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

library(gridExtra)

library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
negative_contributions <- contributions %>% 
  filter(transaction_type == "24A")

positive_contributions <- contributions %>% 
  filter(transaction_type == "24E")

house_elections <- house_elections %>% 
  rename(cand_name = candidate_name)

negative_candidates <- full_join(negative_contributions, candidates, by = "cand_id") %>% 
  group_by(cand_id)

positive_candidates <- full_join(positive_contributions, candidates, by = "cand_id") %>% 
  group_by(cand_id) %>% 
  left_join(house_elections, by = "cand_name")
```
